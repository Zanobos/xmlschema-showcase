My guidelines for the schema creation had been:
-using as much as possible keys and keyrefs, in order to be sure to have correct data with existing references in my application
-using as much as possible the extension and the groups, in order to not duplicate declarations and definitions in the XSD
-use the enumeration constraint to be sure to have only known functionality
-use of the unique element to not duplicate data, such as for the functionalities inside a policy
